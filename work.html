                and see what symbols matched their query.

                event.

                <a href="https://genderdiary.com/">This website</a> was written with plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It
                functions as a tool that allows its users to denote their gender identity in terms of how masculine,
                feminine, and non-binary they feel at a given time. This combination is represented as an RGB value,
                where R represents feminine, G represents non-binary, and B represents masculine. Every gender they've
                logged is viewable on the site, much like a diary. I created this site to help my friend track how they
                were feeling about gender, but I hope it helps others as well.

                the linguistic habits of a group called 'demigirls' and explored how they used pronouns and adjectives
                to reinforce their identities.
