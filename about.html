                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi there! My name's Jack Sorrels, and this is my <i>portfolio website</i>. I currently reside in
                    Orlando, FL and I'm a software developer and lexicographer. Woah, lexicographer? Now that's a
                    five dollar word. Worry not, though! Just a fancy word meaning I can write definitions for
                    dictionaries. With all these cool skills, some might call me a jack of all trades. Surely nobody's
                    ever made that joke before!</p>
                <p>As you may be able to tell, I adore words and am a lover of puns and language, written, spoken, or
                    programmed. I also love tabletop games and am an avid Dungeons & Dragons player when I'm able to
                    participate in a group.</p>
                <p>So, how did I get into software development? Let's go back to the year 2005. Remember Neopets? As it
                    turns out, it was the start of many developers' interest in programming. This is because the site
                    offered the ability to create a custom HTML page for your Neopets, even including an on-site HTML
                    guide to help you learn the ropes. I wanted to be one of the cool kids and have epic Neopets pages
                    so I worked hard to create pages I was proud of. A decade or so later, when I finally started down
                    my actual path of learning C, my experience with Neopets gave me some confidence
                    to believe I could learn a more procedural language.</p>
