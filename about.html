                <p>Hi there! My name's Jack Sorrels, and this is my <i>portfolio website</i>. I currently reside in
                    Orlando, FL and I'm a developer, copywriter, and lexicographer. Woah, lexicographer? Now that's a
                    five dollar word. Worry not, though! Just a fancy word meaning I can write definitions for
                    dictionaries. With all these cool skills, some might call me a jack of all trades. Surely nobody's
                    ever made that joke before!</p>
                <p>As you may be able to tell, I adore words and am a lover of puns and language, written, spoken, or
                    programmed. I also love tabletop games and am an avid Dungeons & Dragons player when I'm able to
                    participate in a group.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me via email at sorrelsjack@gmail.com or via <a
                        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksorrels/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
