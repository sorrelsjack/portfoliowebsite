<p>Hi there. My name's Jack Sorrels, and this is my portfolio website. I currently reside in Orlando, FL and I'm a developer, a copywriter, and lexicographer. Some might call me a jack of all trades.</p>
<br>As you may be able to tell, I adore words and am a lover of puns and language, written, spoken, or programmed. I also love tabletop games and am an avid Dungeons & Dragons player when I'm able to participate in a group.
<br>If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me via email at sorrelsjack@gmail.com or via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksorrels/">LinkedIn</a>.
